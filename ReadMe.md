## 📊 Understanding the report

## ⚠️ Events

Events represent specific moments in the video where the system detected potential UX problems.

Each event includes:
- Timestamp
- Event type

- Severity level

### Event Types

Classification of user friction with the product:

- **Error**  
  Action failed to meet the intended goal.

- **Pause**  
  Unintended or unexplained stop in user activity.

- **Repetition**  
  Redundant actions caused by unclear feedback or interface confusion.

- **Hesitation**  
  Uncertainty or delay in decision-making.

### Severity Levels

Impact on overall User Experience:

- **High**

- Represents expected usability and user satisfaction after applying the change

### Risk

The likelihood of negative consequences:

- **High**  
  Significant change that may alienate users or require high development effort.
